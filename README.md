# Hey there! I'm Aditi 🌞

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I’m a Computer Engineering student who loves creating things for the web.

Right now, I'm on a journey to become a **Frontend Developer** with a flair for **UI/UX Design** (and a growing curiosity for backend too!).

---

### 🌱 Currently Growing In...

- 🧑‍🎨 **HTML & CSS** – where every pixel starts its journey
- ⚛️ **ReactJS** – still wrapping my head around hooks 
- 🎨 **Figma** – where my ideas go from rough scribbles to clickable designs
- 🧠 Understanding the backend side of things (APIs, databases, etc.)

### 💼 Projects I'm Proud Of

- 📺 **YouTube Clone** – HTML & CSS replica of YouTube’s classic layout.    
- 🏙️ **Mumbai Homepage** – a website showcasing the spirit of Mumbai.
- 🏀 **Hoop Score** – a basketball scoreboard app and also my first ever interactive web project!

### 🐥 A Bit About Me

- I believe design should *feel right*, not just look right  
- I enjoy working on meaningful problems and fun side-projects  
- I’m deeply into **cricket**, **cats**, **memes**, **the internet**, and **coffee** (in no particular order ;)  
- Always up for learning something new!
